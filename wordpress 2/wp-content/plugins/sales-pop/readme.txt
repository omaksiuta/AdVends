Beautiful live sales popups to feed recent orders to visitors. Best social proof to motivate customers to purchase and build brand trust.

== Description ==

Around 85% of visitors leave an online store without buying an item. Among many reasons, lack of trust, engagement, and authenticity prevents new visitors from placing an order. Built from the concept of Social Proof, Sales Pop plugin helps you combat the 85% rate of site abandonment with recent sales notifications.

This plugin runs beautiful recent sales popups to notify visitors of recently bought items. When visitors are aware that many other customers are buying from this brand, they will be more confident in making the first purchases.

This strategy is suitable for all businesses of any size. Especially, it works incredibly for new stores which haven’t got many orders and customers yet, by allowing store owners to create “fake” notifications to promote any items as hot sellers.

This plugin is built to seamlessly connect your WooCommerce website to our <a href="https://beeketing.com/sales-pop?utm_channel=applisting&utm_medium=woolisting&utm_fromapp=spop" target="_blank">Sales Pop</a> app on Beeketing platform.
